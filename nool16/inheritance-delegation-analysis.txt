Looking at Noble & friends' ECOOP 2016 paper:

down	yes, possibly through encoding, not necessarily during initialization
reg		yes, but through a design pattern
action	no action at a distance (in my view)
fresh	inherit from any
stab.	stable
multi.	yes

forwarding + custom downcall support
	through custom support
		** demonstrate a clean design here!
	reg through a design pattern
		** prove it!


why no multiple forwarding or delegation in their model?
