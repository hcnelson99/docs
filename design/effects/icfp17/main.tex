\begin{abstract}
Capabilities are increasingly used to reason informally about the properties of secure systems.  Can capabilities also aid in \textit{formal} reasoning?  To answer this question, we examine a calculus that uses effects to capture resource use and extend it with a rule that captures the essence of capability-based reasoning.  We demonstrate that capabilities provide a way to reason for free about effects: we can bound the effects of an expression based on the capabilities to which it has access.  This reasoning is ``free'' in that they rely only on typechecking (not effect-checking); they do not require the programmer to add effect annotations within the expression, nor do they require a tool to analyze the expression's structure for its effects.  Our result sheds light on the essence of what capabilities provide and suggests useful ways of integrating lightweight capability-based reasoning into languages.
