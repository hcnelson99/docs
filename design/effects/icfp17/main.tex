\begin{abstract}
Many modern applications require developers to build safe systems out of potentially unsafe components, but existing languages are insufficient in the techniques they provide for identifying untrustworthy or unsafe code. This paper explores how capability-safety enables a low overhead effect-system that can reason about the authority of unannotated code. We demonstrate this with a capability calculus $\epscalc$ and give several scenarios where it helps developers make more informed choices about whether to trust code.
