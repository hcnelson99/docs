\section{Conclusions}

We introduced $\opercalc$, a lambda calculus with primitive capabilities and their effects. $\opercalc$ programs are fully annotated with their effects. Relaxing this requirement, we obtained $\epscalc$, which allows unannotated code to be nested inside annotated code with a new $\kwa{import}$ construct. The capability-safe design of $\epscalc$ allows us to safely infer the effects of unannotated code by inspecting what capabilities are passed into it by its annotated surroundings. Such an approach allows code to be incrementally annotated, giving developers a balance between safety and convenience and alleviating the verbosity that has discouraged widespread adoption of effect systems \cite{rytz12}.

More broadly, our results demonstrate that the most basic form of capability-based reasoning---that you can infer what code can do based on what capabilities are passed to it---is not only useful for informal reasoning, but can improve formal reasoning about code by reducing the necessary annotation overhead.

\subsection{Related Work}

While much related work has already been discussed as part of the presentation, here we cover some additional strands related to capabilities and effects.

Capabilities were introduced by \cite{dennis66} to control which processes in an operating system had permission to access which operating system resources.
These early ideas were adapted to the programming language setting as the object capability model, exemplified in the work of Mark \cite{miller06}, which constrains how permissions may proliferate among objects in a distributed system.
\cite{maffeis10} formalised the notion of a capability-safe language and showed that a subset of Caja (a Javascript implementation) is capability-safe.
%Other capability-safe languages include Wyvern \cite{nistor13} and Newspeak \cite{bracha10}.
Miller's model has been applied to more heavyweight systems: \cite{drossopoulou07} combined Hoare logic with capabilities to formalise the notion of trust. Capability-safety parallels have been explored in the operating systems literature, where similar restrictions on dynamic loading and resource access \cite{hunt07} enable static, lightweight analyses to enforce privilege separation \cite{madhavapeddy13}.

The original effect system by \cite{lucassen88} was used to determine what expressions could safely execute in parallel. Subsequent applications include determining what functions a program might invoke \cite{tang94} and what regions in memory might be accessed or updated during execution \cite{talpin94}. In these systems, ``effects'' are performed upon ``regions''; in ours, ``operations'' are performed upon ``resources'''. $\epscalc$ also distinguishes between unannotated and annotated code: only the latter will type-and-effect-check. Another capability-based effect system is the one by \cite{devriese16}, who use effect polymorphism and possible world semantics to express behavioural invariants on data structures. $\epscalc$ is not as expressive, since it only topographically inspects how capabilities can be passed around a program, but the resulting formalism and theory is much more lightweight.

\subsection{Future Work}

Our effects model only the use of capabilities which manipulate system resources. This definition could be generalised to track other sorts of effects, such as stateful updates. In our model, resources and operations are fixed throughout runtime; it would be interesting to consider the theory when they can be created and destroyed at runtime.

The current theory contains no effect polymorphism, whereby a function's type is parameterised by a set of effects. The only way for such a function to typecheck in $\epscalc$ would be to approximate it as having every effect, in which case all precision has been lost. A polymorphic effect system which considers such a function as having an effect parameterised type could give more meaningful approximations.

Many believe in the value of the object capability model, but we do not fully understand its formal benefits. We hope to extend the ideas in this paper to the point where they might be used in capability-safe languages to help authority-safe design and development. Implementing these ideas in a general-purpose, capability-safe language would do much towards that end.

While we have captured the most obvious and basic form of capability-based reasoning about effects, the ideas here could potentially be useful in other kinds of formal reasoning system.
Furthermore, there may be other kinds of reasoning about capabilities---e.g. those being explored by \cite{drossopoulou07}---that also provide benefit in a broad set of formal tools.
